            Hello! My name is <b>Hernan Rodriguez</b>, I'm originally from Argentina but I currently live in Spain with my wife and children. I've been working as a software developer at a company located in Utah for a couple of years and I really enjoy my job.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some of the things I like to do besides programming are playing and watching soccer, reading a lot of books, playing guitar and listening to music in general, and also spending time with my family in nature. In the city where we currently live we have the beach very close so it's a blessing to be able to go and spend time there with the kids.
        </p>
